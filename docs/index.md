## Overview
Lenser is a package of python programs used to analyze FITS files of galaxies. First, the user must input a "postage stamp" containing one galaxy. Next, Lenser will deproject the image to show what the galaxy looked like before the contortion due to gravitanal lensing. Then, Lenser will output the four flexion parameters associated with the inputted galaxy.

Lenser is a powerful tool that will quickly compute lensing data for a given galaxy. It uses a pipeline of programs that refine and improve the prediction and measurment of the deprojection and flexion values.
